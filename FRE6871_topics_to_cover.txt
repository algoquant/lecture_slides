the default path is the first of these.
You can override that via an argument to both install.packages() (from inside R) or R CMD INSTALL (outside R).

# email grading

You received one of the lowest scores, so I think that your final grade of B- is generous and fair.
Most students received very high scores.  You had low scores on two tests.  Your score was close to the median of other scores, so I think that your final grade of B+ is generous and fair.
Course letter grades were derived from the cumulative scores, but there was no fixed formula.  Most students received quite high scores.  Your score was below the median of other scores, so I think that your final grade of B+ is generous and fair.
Thank you for your kind words, and best of luck.

# email

Dear Students,
According to Albert, the dates for FRE-GY 7241 I2 Algorithmic Portfolio Management, are from Oct. 29 to Dec. 19, 2014.

Dear Students,
Below is the link to the survey results for the FRE6871 course.  12 students answered so far, and the feedback is pretty positive.  I hope you can take FRE7241 Algorithmic Portfolio Management next Spring.

https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-DT367KKJ/

### grading and partial credit policies

Homeworks and tests contain several parts, with each part assigned a maximum score. 
Please grade each part separately, assign it a numerical score, and add up all the scores to get the total homework or test score.
Enter the total scores for the homeworks and tests into the attached spreadsheet.  

Write the actual scores next to the maximum scores in the students' *.R files, and email them back to students.  But wait until after the deadline and after all students have submitted their *.R files
Please let me know when you've received all the homeworks each week after they're due so that I may post the solutions.

Please give partial credit as follows: 
Paste the students' code into an R session to verify that it produces the correct answer.
Maximum scores should be given only for complete code that produces the correct answer when pasted into an R session. 
Code that produces the correct answer, and follows the instructions to use specific functions, should receive the maximum score, even if it differs from the solution code.
Give partial credit equal to about 2/3 max score for code that is almost right: it doesn't produce the correct answer, but produces a slightly different answer due to minor errors.
Give partial credit of about 1/3 max score for code that has several major errors (wrong function or variable), but that has some correct code that can be useful for producing the correct answer.
Give zero score for code that's completely incorrect and useless for producing the correct answer.

Plagiarism
Students are allowed to copy code from course slides, books, or any online sources.  But students must provide references to any external sources from which they copy code (such as links, or titles and page numbers).
Students are not allowed to copy code from each other.  Please alert me if you see that different students have submitted close to identical code.


### ideas for test:

create lag function for vectors:
sig_nal <- c(0, sig_nal)

### R environment

set R_PROFILE variable

setting up .RProfile file
customizations


.Rprofile file shouldn't include any code that affects the results of programs, as this would make them irreproducible for other users.
.Rprofile file shouldn't load packages, change the options of functions, define functions etc. 
Instead, add an initialization script at the top level of every project file
R code should be self-contained and reproducible 


special functions
.First
.Last


.Rprofile file can include code that changes the appearance of R:

# describing options() params
# set global options
options()
# get global options
getOption()

example:
option_values <- options()  # get all global options
length(option_values)
head(option_values)
tail(option_values)
options("digits")
options(digits=3)

# set wide display for multiple monitors
options(width=160)

getOption("max.print")
options("max.print")
options(max.print=100)

# set default CRAN mirror
options(repos=c(CRAN="http://cran.rstudio.com")))

# set prompt
options(prompt="R", digits=4, show.signif.stars=FALSE)

# customize windows graphics defaults
setHook(packageEvent("grDevices", "onLoad"),
        function(...)
            grDevices::windows.options(width=8, height=6,
                                       xpos=0, pointsize=10,
                                       bitmap.aa.win="cleartype"))


###


# style guide
I follow Hadley Wickham's style guide, with some small exceptions.
I liked your points about using whitespace to enhance readability and shorten length of lines.

I personally dislike the '<-' assignment operator, but I still use it in R, instead of '='.  The reason is that the two assignment operators are not equivalent in R.
The '<-' and '=' operators differ in scope and precedence ('<-' has higher precedence than '=')

The '=' operator is used for named arguments in function calls.

As a rule of thumb, I use '<-' in R scripts, and I use '=' in function calls.

If I had a choice, I would completely eliminate the '<-' assignment operator.


### Control statements

inside if() statements almost always use '||' and '&&'


use this:
my_var <- if (my_clause) A.expression else B.expression

instead of this:
if (my_clause) {
my_var <- A.expression
} else {
my_var <- B.expression
}

### data types and classes

### data structures

### vectors

rep()


### tips and tricks

### matrices

don't allocate empty numeric matrix using
x <- matrix(nrow=500, ncol=100)
it creates logical values

as soon as you assign a numeric value to any of the cells in 'x', 
the matrix will first have to be coerced to numeric when a new value is assigned.

Instead allocate empty matrix using

x <- matrix(NA_real_, nrow=500, ncol=100)  # real matrix
x <- matrix(NA_integer_, nrow=500, ncol=100)


# don't grow matrices, instead of:
rmat <- NULL
for (i in 1:n)  {
	rmat <- rbind(rmat, long.computation(i,.....))
}

# use:

rmat <- matrix(0.0, n, k)  # allocate
for (i in 1:n)  {
	rmat[i,] <- long.computation(i,.....)
}

# another example:
http://www.bioinformaticszen.com/post/simple-functional-programming-in-r/

married <- c("Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","","No","Yes")
# now initialize and grow - will perform poorly because the new vector binary.married is recreated each time to add a new element onto the end.
binary.married <- c()
for (i in 1:length(married)) {
  if(married[i] == "Yes"){
    binary.married <- c(binary.married, 1)
  } else {
    binary.married <- c(binary.married, 0)
  }
}

# use instead:
binary.married <- rep(0, length(married))
for (i in 1:length(married)) {
  if(married[i] == "Yes") binary.married[i] <- 1
}

# rewrite above using apply
binary.married <- sapply(married, function (x) (x=="Yes"))
binary.married <- sapply(married, function (x) switch(x, Yes=1, No=0, NA))

# even better:
character.to.binary <- function(x) {
  switch(x, Yes=1, No=0, NA)
}
binary.married <- sapply(married, character.to.binary)

# Proportion of respondents married
mean(binary.married[binary.married != ""])
mean(binary.married, na.rm=TRUE)


# for large n, better to create transpose, column by column, instead of row by row:
tmat <- matrix(0.0, k, n)
for (i in 1:n)  {
	tmat[, i] <- long.computation(i, .....)
}

UseMethod()
When a function calling UseMethod("fun") is applied to an object with class attribute c("first", "second"), the system searches for a function called fun.first and, if it finds it, applies it to the object. 
If no such function is found a function called fun.second is tried. 
If no class name produces a suitable function, the function fun.default is used, if it exists, or an error results.

### environments

new.env()

An environment is very similar to a list, with three important exceptions:
Environments have parents. 
There is only one exception: the empty environment does not have a parent.

The parent environment of a function is the environment in which a function was defined

the top-level environment is the global environment (workspace) or the namespace of a package

first-class environments can be manipulated from within the language

parent frame: the latter (returned by parent.frame) refers to the environment of the caller of a function.

### scope

create separate slide for Lexical Scoping
Environments are the data structures that power scoping
Lexical vs. Dynamic Scoping
Explain Lexical Scoping on example
If an object is not found in an environment, then R will look at its parent (and so on). 

When a function is evaluated, $R$ looks in the function search path for any variables in scope,
\vskip1ex
The evaluation environment is first, then the functions enclosing environment, which will be the global environment for functions defined in the workspace.
\vskip1ex
When R looks up the value for a symbol the frame is examined and if a matching symbol is found its value will be returned. If not, the enclosing environment is then accessed and the process repeated. 
\vskip1ex

global variables can be referenced inside a function.

### Functions

# Recursive functions
# R supports recursive functions. The function below computes Fibonacci numbers recursively.

# Functions in R are "first class objects"
which means that they can be treated much like any other R object. 
Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
Functions can be nested, so that you can define a function inside of another function
Functions can return functions as their result

Functions as Objects - Functions returning functions
Functions that return another function as its value
functions defined inside other functions

# anonymous functions
(function(x) x + 3)(10)
apply() with anonymous functions
anonymous functions as arguments to functions

formulas as arguments to functions


Explain on examples why defining functions inside other functions is useful in analysis


# Function factories
Closures are useful for making function factories, and are one way to manage mutable state in R.

function environments disappear once the function finishes executing, but when a function returns a function, then its environment is attached to the new function. 

# mutable states
mutable states can be modified using the "superassignment" operator "<<-" or the function assign()

the function assign() assigns a value to a name in an environment
the default is to assign in the enclosing environment

### Condition Handling and Recovery
Exception Handling in R
# keywords:
exception handling trycatch
R debugging
error handling

function error and warning handling
function exception handling
try()
tryCatch()


Conditions: Errors and Warnings
Warnings are much more common than Errors
Errors occur when: matching arguments, if/else statement not logical or a numeric, recycle rule
Error options
There are a number of options variables that can be used to control how R handles errors and warnings. The are listed in the table below.
‘warn’
Controls the printing of warnings.
‘warning.expression’
Sets an expression that is to be evaluated when a warning occurs. The normal printing of warnings is suppressed if this option is set.
‘error’
Installs an expression that will be evaluated when an error occurs. The normal printing of error messages and warning messages precedes the evaluation of the expression.
warnings can be created using the function warning()
takes a single argument that is a character string
the option "warn" 
The behaviour of a call to warning depends on the value of 

# check the class of try object to determine if call was successful
tmp_instr <- try(getInstrument(this_symbol, silent=FALSE))
if (inherits(tmp_instr, "try-error") || !is.instrument(tmp_instr)) 

# using "recover" function for error handling
options(error=recover)
http://www.burns-stat.com/the-options-mechanism-in-r/
https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/recover.html

# try an Expression Allowing Error Recovery
http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/try.html


### functionals

functionals extract common patterns of loop use

# explain this syntax for removing zero length list elements
my_list <- list('a', 2, integer(0))
my_list[lapply(my_list, length)>0]


# apply functions

create exercise to convert for loop to apply call

with(PlantGrowth, tapply(weight, group, sem))

from:
http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html
x <- list(1:3, 4:9, 10:12)
sapply(x, "[", 2)
#> [1]  2  5 11

# equivalent to
sapply(x, function(x) x[2])
#> [1]  2  5 11

http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functionals.html

sapply() is a thin wrapper around lapply() that transforms a list into a vector in the final step

sapply() silently returns a list if the function returns results of different types or lengths
vapply() will throw an error

sapply() guesses the output type
vapply() takes an additional argument of output type
use sapply() interactively 
use vapply() inside other functions

good examples
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15733518/efficient-way-to-loop-in-r?rq=1

Wickham Split Apply Combine for Data Analysis

Higher-order functions - apply functions
takes one or more functions as an input - outputs a function
The map function is an example of a higher-order function.
The apply function is the most basic of R's map functions. 
apply takes as arguments an array, a vector of the dimension to map along and a function. 

split and apply example:
http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/05/tricky-interview-questions/
a <- c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2)
b <- c(10,12,15,12,NA,30,42,38,40)
s <- split(b,a)
