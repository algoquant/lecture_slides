### replies

I'm already supervising two capstone projects in the Spring 2017 semester, so I can't supervise another project now.
I may be able to supervise capstone projects later in the year, but the requirement is strong programming skills in either Python or C++.
Maybe you can contact me at the end of the Spring 2017 semester, if you're still interested.

I added you to NYU Classes. 
Have you used the R language?
If you haven't taken the course FRE6871 R in Finance, then I encourage you to attend classes.
Have you taken courses by prof. Song Tang?

Thank you, you are very welcome. 
I appreciate you recommending my courses to other students.
Thank you very much for your kind words, and for your hard work!

Are you proficient with the R language?


# Assignments
You can click on the Assignments tab on the left, view the homework or test file, download it, and finally submit your files from there.

Dear Students,
Welcome to FRE6871 R in Finance.  Please see attached the syllabus. 
I'm glad to see that so many students have registered for this course.  In this course you'll learn the R language, and also how to apply it to finance, like modelling interest rate yield curves using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), building credit scoring models using logistic regression, and pricing options using Monte Carlo simulation.
But I must warn you that many students find this course to be difficult, because the R language is considered to be challenging.  So this course requires good programming skills, and students should therefore have some programming experience with either the R language, or other languages such as C++ or Python.

The course FRE6871 R in Finance is designed as an introduction to R, while FRE7241 Algorithmic Portfolio Management is designed as a followup course for teaching applications of R to portfolio management.  I recommend taking the courses sequentially, first FRE6871 and then FRE7241.


Dear Students,
Please take the following free Datacamp interactive course "Introduction to R":

https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r

After you finish the course, you should receive a certificate file from Datacamp.  You can also go to your DataCamp profile page, and scroll to the bottom, where you will see an icon to the courses you finished, and a link that allows you to download the Datacamp certificate file.
Please submit the certificate file to NYU Classes.  It will be due Monday, Sep. 12th, at 12:00 PM.

# homeworks

Dear Students,
Please submit your homeworks and tests using NYU Classes instead of email.
You can click on the Assignments tab on the left in NYU Classes.
From there you can view the assigned homework or test file, download it, and finally submit your files from there.

Dear Students,
You must submit homeworks by the time they are due, or you won't receive full credit.
Homeworks are due as follows:
HW #3 is due 05-04-15
HW #4 is due 05-11-15
Homeworks #1 and #2 are past due.

Dear Students,
I would like to encourage everyone to ask more questions in class.
Please take every opportunity to ask questions, so that you understand every line of code in the lecture notes.
Understanding the code in the lecture notes will help you with obtaining higher scores on homeworks and tests, since they are based on lecture notes.

Dear Students,
Please install the following software:
The R Interpreter:
	http://cran.r-project.org/
RStudio IDE:
	http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/


Please send an email to students asking what is the most convenient time for them for office hours.

Dear Students,
I'm scheduling a make-up class because there are four lectures left in this course, but only three weeks left in the Semester.
I plan to deliver lectures on the following dates:  Nov. 21st, Nov. 24th, Dec. 1st, and Dec. 8th.
There will be a lecture on Monday Nov. 24th, as usual.

Dear Students,
I would like to schedule a make-up class this Friday, Nov 21st from 6PM to 9PM.  Please let me know if this is inconvenient for you.

Dear Students,
The Teaching Assistant is Xirui (Sherry) He (xh521@nyu.edu).
Please email all homeworks and tests to Sherry He.

Dear Students,
Starting next week I will be teaching FRE7241 Algorithmic Portfolio Management.  
This course will apply the R language to portfolio management, and will be a great opportunity to apply what you've learned in the R course.  
Some of the topics covered will be:

The first lecture will be on Tuesday Nov 4th.

# email grading

You received one of the lowest scores, so I think that your final grade of B- is generous and fair.
Most students received very high scores.  You had low scores on two tests.  Your score was close to the median of other scores, so I think that your final grade of B+ is generous and fair.
Course letter grades were derived from the cumulative scores, but there was no fixed formula.  Most students received quite high scores.  Your score was below the median of other scores, so I think that your final grade of B+ is generous and fair.
Thank you for your kind words, and best of luck.


# email to Dawei,
The way to improve your programming skills is by running the lecture code in an R session, analyzing it, and modifying it to better understand how it works (experimenting with the lecture code).  Unfortunately not enough students ask me in class about the lecture code, which must mean that either they find the lecture code totally clear, or they haven't studied it as part of their homework assignments.

The purpose of this course is to teach students how to analyze existing code, and how to adapt it to solve new problems.  This means that you will have to write new code by combining and modifying existing code.  By its nature this can be very challenging.

I carefully design the tests so they can be solved by combining and modifying existing code lecture code.  If you find that some test solutions require code that is unrelated to the lecture code, then please alert me to them.

I have taken your suggestion and provided more detailed instructions for the upcoming test, so that you can start solving the test assignments ahead of time.  I will also provide hints during the test, to guide you along.

The course will have six tests in total, so you still have a chance to improve your average tests scores if you perform well on future tests.


# email

Dear Students,
According to Albert, the dates for FRE-GY 7241 I2 Algorithmic Portfolio Management, are from Oct. 29 to Dec. 19, 2014.
So there will be no class on Oct. 28.  The first class will be on Tuesday Nov 4th.
It would be much better if you could attend.  I will be presenting a lot of new material in the R language.

# email for test:

Dear Students,
Please install packages: moments, ggplot2, gridExtra, wordcloud

Dear Students,
There will be an in-class test this Monday, September 26th. 
The test will start at 6:30 PM, and will last 60min until 7:30 PM.
I will upload the test file at 6:30PM to NYU Classes.
The lecture will start at 6:00 PM, as usual.  
You must bring your laptops and be able to log into WiFi.

The test will be based on lecture notes, so please study the topics below:

Classifying numeric data into categories according to breakpoints using function findInterval().
Splitting data frames according to categories using function split().
Performing the split-apply-combine procedure using function sapply() and an anonymous function. 
Study slide 38 "The lapply() Functional" in the functions.pdf, and slide 39 "The sapply() Functional", and analyze the code.
Plotting scatterplots using functions plot(), points(), and text().
Creating wrapper functions designed to validate their arguments.
Performing for(), apply(), and sapply() loops over matrices and data frames. 
Performing while loops instead of for() loops. 

You will be required to create a wrapper for function sum(), called sum_rob(), which performs validation of its dots "..." argument, and returns NULL if the argument isn't valid. 
The function sum_rob() should accept the same arguments as function sum(): dots "..." argument and "na.rm=FALSE". 

The function sum_rob() should validate its dots "..." argument to check that it's either a numeric atomic object, or a list containing numeric objects, and return its sum.  
If it's neither, then it should return NULL.
The function sum_rob() should pass its "na.rm" argument to the "na.rm" argument of function sum(). 

There are many ways of implementing function sum_rob().
You can use functions list(), unlist(), is.list(), is.numeric(), length(), c(), do.call(), return(), and sum().

Call sum_rob() as follows, to verify that it works correctly.
You should get the following results:

sum_rob(1:9)
#   [1] 45
sum_rob(matrix(1:9, 3))
#   [1] 45
sum_rob(list(1:9, 3))
#   [1] 48
sum_rob(1, 2, 3, NA)
#   [1] NA
sum_rob(1, 2, 3, NA, na.rm=TRUE)
#   [1] 6
sum_rob(1, 2, 3:5, NA, na.rm=TRUE)
#   [1] 15
sum_rob(iris[, 4])
#   [1] 179.9
sum_rob(iris[, 5])
# NULL
sum_rob("a")
# NULL
sum_rob(list(1, 2, 3))
#   [1] 6
sum_rob(list(1, 2, 3, NA))
#   [1] NA
sum_rob(list(1, 2, 3, NA), na.rm=TRUE)
#   [1] 6
sum_rob(list(1, 2, 3, "a"))
#   NULL



Subsetting data frames using logical operators. 
Using function which() to extract elements of data frames. 
Using anonymous functions in apply() loops. 
Omitting NA values in loops. 
Performing vectorized operations over vectors, matrices, and data frames.
Benchmarking the CPU time used by R operations using package microbenchmark.
Defining functions with the dots "..." argument. 
Passing arguments through the dots "..." argument of apply(). 

Performing operations in the R workspace: listing, removing, and saving objects, changing and displaying options settings. 
Creating, subsetting, and substituting strings. 
Creating vectors of strings from numeric vectors and strings using paste(). 
Assigning names, row and column names, and attributes to objects.

Coercing factors into vectors. 
Performing the split-apply-combine procedure using sapply() and lapply() loops. 
(study slide 32 in expressions.pdf - download the newest version from NYU Classes.)
Performing operations inside with() environments. 
Transposing matrices. 
Multiplying matrices by vectors, and multiplying vectors by matrices. 
you will be using the student_scores data frame from homework #3 

Plotting histograms
Calculating contingency tables. 
reading files containing bad data elements,
coercing data frames and factors to numeric,

You will need to use the following functions:
for(), apply(), sapply(), integer(), seq_along(), c(), unlist(), max(), min(), matrix(), sample(), paste0(), ncol(), 


rnorm(), mean(), sd(), ls(), glob2rx(), save(), rm(), options(), paste(), paste0(), strsplit(), gsub(), which(), names(), colnames(), c(), list(), matrix(), dim(), attributes(),

The reason that the student's code may not reproduce the exact expected values, is because they didn't reset the random number generator.
In that case you need to analyze their code to determine if it's correct or not.
The most important criterion is if the student's code makes basic sense, or if they're lost.  You have to make that judgement.  
Feel free to ask me for advice in specific cases.

You can be generous with awarding partial credit, even when the student's code doesn't reproduce the exact expected values, as long asthe code is basically correct, except for some minor errors.

Homeworks and tests contain several parts, with each part assigned a maximum score. 
Please grade each part separately, assign it a numerical score, and add up all the scores to get the total homework or test score.
Enter the total scores for the homeworks and tests into the attached spreadsheet.  

Write the actual scores next to the maximum scores in the students' *.R files, and email them back to students.  But wait until after the deadline and after all students have submitted their *.R files
Please let me know when you've received all the homeworks each week after they're due so that I may post the solutions.

Please give partial credit as follows: 
Paste the students' code into an R session to verify that it produces the correct answer.
Maximum scores should be given only for complete code that produces the correct answer when pasted into an R session. 
Code that produces the correct answer, and follows the instructions to use specific functions, should receive the maximum score, even if it differs from the solution code.
Give partial credit equal to about 2/3 max score for code that is almost right: it doesn't produce the correct answer, but produces a slightly different answer due to minor errors.
Give partial credit of about 1/3 max score for code that has several major errors (wrong function or variable), but that has some correct code that can be useful for producing the correct answer.
Give zero score for code that's completely incorrect and useless for producing the correct answer.

Plagiarism
Students are allowed to copy code from course slides, books, or any online sources.  But students must provide references to any external sources from which they copy code (such as links, or titles and page numbers).
Students are not allowed to copy code from each other.  Please alert me if you see that different students have submitted close to identical code.

### homework topics existing best

# Summary: Perform logistic regression to forecast

# Summary: Calculate the standard errors of regression 
# coefficients using bootstrap simulations. 



###############
### homework and test ideas

+ [ ] reproduce PCA and all plots, using scaling of returns, and demonstrate that it improves the solved time series

+ [ ] apply antithetic sampling to calculate the standard errors of VaR and CVaR and bootstrap

+ [x] create zoo plot of yield curves

+ [x] apply PCA to interest rates

+ [x] create plotly of 20yr and 10yr Treasury rates

+ [x] calculate the standard errors of CVaR using parallel bootstrap

+ [x] calculate vector of CVaR using sapply() loop and integrate()
use the slide: Conditional Value at Risk Under the Vasicek Model

+ [x] calculate vector of CVaR using sapply() loop and simulation
use the slide: Simulating CVaR Under the Vasicek Model

+ [x] calculate standard errors of VaR and CVaR using bootstrap

+ [ ] transform uniform random numbers into normal random numbers with given mean and standard deviation
use qnorm(runif(100))
or Box-Muller transform
http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/132556/advantages-of-box-muller-over-inverse-cdf-method-for-simulating-normal-distribut
x <- sqrt(-2*log(u))*cos(2*pi*v)
y <- sqrt(-2*log(u))*sin(2*pi*v)

+ [ ] modify run_reg() so that it produces error, instead of producing error in loop 
# Summary: Perform regressions in an sapply loop, 
# and produce an error when the p-value is greater 
# than the significance level. 

+ [ ] use slides "Influence of Noise on Regression" and "Omitted Variable Bias"
in loop increase weight of omit_var and extract vectors of DW tests

+ [ ] Perform error handling within an sapply loop. 

+ [ ] vectorize code of function preda()
predc: use differences of cumsum()
from: Matloff book The Art of R Programming, p. 37

+ [ ] make code of function findruns() faster
from: Matloff book The Art of R Programming, Finding Runs of Consecutive Ones

+ [ ] create new variables from list of column names of EuStockMarkets
use assign(), and apply() or sapply(), not for() loop

+ [ ] create a function with a bug and ask to fix the bug

+ [ ] create vector of four names using paste()
vec_names <- paste0("var", 1:4)
# create a named vector of four random values using rnorm()
vec_rand <- rnorm(4)
# assign names to vector from vec_names (?)
names(vec_rand) <- vec_names
# create four variables from the vector of four names and assign them to the vector of four random values
# use a for() loop and assign()
for (var_name in vec_names) {
# assign column values to column names
  assign(var_name, vec_rand[var_name])
}  # end for
# or
for (in_dex in 1:4) {
# assign column values to column names
  assign(vec_names[in_dex], vec_rand[in_dex])
}  # end for

+ [ ] ideas for test:
create toy script:
convert EuStockMarkets to zoo
introduce NAs
save it to file
read data from file in lapply loop
file has bad data and loop bombs
assignment:
fix loop using tryCatch
lapply loop returns list
flatten list to zoo

+ [ ] simulate option price
estimate standard deviation of estimated price
wrap it in a function
compare speed of while() loop with vectorized code
create vectorized double barrier option ?

+ [ ] calling nested functions with dots '...' argument before or after dots

+ [ ] functional called by sapply loop takes dots '...' argument and passes dots to function
sapply passes argument to functional
similar to optim example 
regression example

+ [ ] sapply loop sometimes returns list
use vapply instead
http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/sapply-returning-list-instead-of-matrix-td4684523.html
a <- function(i) { list(1) } 
b <- function(i) { list(1,2) } 
ll <- sapply(seq(3), a, simplfy="list") 
mm <- sapply(seq(3), b) 
class(ll) 
class(mm) 

+ [ ] sapply vs vapply example
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9668456/why-does-sapply-return-a-list
sapply(LETTERS[1:3], function(x) {x == "B"}) # F, T, F
sapply(LETTERS[0], function(x) {x == "B"})   # list()
vapply(LETTERS[1:3], function(x) {x == "B"}, logical(1)) # F, T, F
vapply(LETTERS[0], function(x) {x == "B"}, logical(1))   # logical()

+ [ ] create a function that downloads and saves data for a list of symbols
use functions:	Filter, assign, get, as.name, 

+ [ ] perform double barrier simulation using vectorized functions

+ [x] simulate homogeneous (uniform) portfolio using vectorized functions, and plot histogram of defaults, then add curve of Vasicek model

+ [x] simulate correlated defaults under Vasicek model, and calculate vector of number of defaults, first using sapply(), then using vectorized functions
use microbenchmark

### R environment

set R_PROFILE variable

setting up .RProfile file
customizations


.Rprofile file shouldn't include any code that affects the results of programs, as this would make them irreproducible for other users.
.Rprofile file shouldn't load packages, change the options of functions, define functions etc. 
Instead, add an initialization script at the top level of every project file
R code should be self-contained and reproducible 

special functions
.First
.Last

.Rprofile file can include code that changes the appearance of R:

# describing options() params
# set global options
options()
# get global options
getOption()

example:
option_values <- options()  # get all global options
length(option_values)
head(option_values)
tail(option_values)
options("digits")
options(digits=3)

# set wide display for multiple monitors
options(width=160)

getOption("max.print")
options("max.print")
options(max.print=100)

# set default CRAN mirror
options(repos=c(CRAN="http://cran.rstudio.com")))

# set prompt
options(prompt="R", digits=4, show.signif.stars=FALSE)

# customize windows graphics defaults
setHook(packageEvent("grDevices", "onLoad"),
        function(...)
            grDevices::windows.options(width=8, height=6,
                                       xpos=0, pointsize=10,
                                       bitmap.aa.win="cleartype"))


###


# style guide
I follow Hadley Wickham's style guide, with some small exceptions.
I liked your points about using whitespace to enhance readability and shorten length of lines.

I personally dislike the '<-' assignment operator, but I still use it in R, instead of '='.  The reason is that the two assignment operators are not equivalent in R.
The '<-' and '=' operators differ in scope and precedence ('<-' has higher precedence than '=')

The '=' operator is used for named arguments in function calls.

As a rule of thumb, I use '<-' in R scripts, and I use '=' in function calls.

If I had a choice, I would completely eliminate the '<-' assignment operator.


### Control statements

inside if() statements almost always use '||' and '&&'


use this:
my_var <- if (my_clause) A.expression else B.expression

instead of this:
if (my_clause) {
my_var <- A.expression
} else {
my_var <- B.expression
}

# another example:
http://www.bioinformaticszen.com/post/simple-functional-programming-in-r/

married <- c("Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","","No","Yes")
# now initialize and grow - will perform poorly because the new vector binary.married is recreated each time to add a new element onto the end.
binary.married <- c()
for (i in 1:length(married)) {
  if(married[i] == "Yes"){
    binary.married <- c(binary.married, 1)

# use instead:
binary.married <- rep(0, length(married))
for (i in 1:length(married)) {
  if(married[i] == "Yes") binary.married[i] <- 1
}

# rewrite above using apply
binary.married <- sapply(married, function (x) (x=="Yes"))
binary.married <- sapply(married, function (x) switch(x, Yes=1, No=0, NA))

# even better:
character.to.binary <- function(x) {
  switch(x, Yes=1, No=0, NA)
}
binary.married <- sapply(married, character.to.binary)

# Proportion of respondents married
mean(binary.married[binary.married != ""])

# for large n, better to create transpose, column by column, instead of row by row:

UseMethod()
When a function calling UseMethod("fun") is applied to an object with class attribute c("first", "second"), the system searches for a function called fun.first and, if it finds it, applies it to the object. 
If no such function is found a function called fun.second is tried. 
If no class name produces a suitable function, the function fun.default is used, if it exists, or an error results.

An environment is very similar to a list, with three important exceptions:
Environments have parents. 
There is only one exception: the empty environment does not have a parent.

The parent environment of a function is the environment in which a function was defined

the top-level environment is the global environment (workspace) or the namespace of a package

first-class environments can be manipulated from within the language

parent frame: the latter (returned by parent.frame) refers to the environment of the caller of a function.

### scope

create separate slide for Lexical Scoping
Environments are the data structures that power scoping
Lexical vs. Dynamic Scoping
Explain Lexical Scoping on example
If an object is not found in an environment, then R will look at its parent (and so on). 

When a function is evaluated, $R$ looks in the function search path for any variables in scope,
\vskip1ex
The evaluation environment is first, then the functions enclosing environment, which will be the global environment for functions defined in the workspace.
\vskip1ex
When R looks up the value for a symbol the frame is examined and if a matching symbol is found its value will be returned. If not, the enclosing environment is then accessed and the process repeated. 
\vskip1ex

global variables can be referenced inside a function.

### Functions

# Recursive functions
# R supports recursive functions. The function below computes Fibonacci numbers recursively.

# Functions in R are "first class objects"
which means that they can be treated much like any other R object. 
Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
Functions can be nested, so that you can define a function inside of another function
Functions can return functions as their result

Functions as Objects - Functions returning functions
Functions that return another function as its value
functions defined inside other functions

# anonymous functions
(function(x) x + 3)(10)
apply() with anonymous functions
anonymous functions as arguments to functions

formulas as arguments to functions


Explain on examples why defining functions inside other functions is useful in analysis


# Function factories
Closures are useful for making function factories, and are one way to manage mutable state in R.

function environments disappear once the function finishes executing, but when a function returns a function, then its environment is attached to the new function. 

# mutable states
mutable states can be modified using the "superassignment" operator "<<-" or the function assign()

the function assign() assigns a value to a name in an environment
the default is to assign in the enclosing environment

### Condition Handling and Recovery
Exception Handling in R
# keywords:
exception handling trycatch
R debugging
error handling

function error and warning handling
function exception handling
try()
tryCatch()


Conditions: Errors and Warnings
Warnings are much more common than Errors
Errors occur when: matching arguments, if/else statement not logical or a numeric, recycle rule
Error options
There are a number of options variables that can be used to control how R handles errors and warnings. The are listed in the table below.
warn
Controls the printing of warnings.
warning.expression
Sets an expression that is to be evaluated when a warning occurs. The normal printing of warnings is suppressed if this option is set.
error
Installs an expression that will be evaluated when an error occurs. The normal printing of error messages and warning messages precedes the evaluation of the expression.
warnings can be created using the function warning()
takes a single argument that is a character string
the option "warn" 
The behaviour of a call to warning depends on the value of 

# check the class of try object to determine if call was successful
tmp_instr <- try(getInstrument(this_symbol, silent=FALSE))
if (inherits(tmp_instr, "try-error") || !is.instrument(tmp_instr)) 

# using "recover" function for error handling
options(error=recover)
http://www.burns-stat.com/the-options-mechanism-in-r/
https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/recover.html

# try an Expression Allowing Error Recovery
http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/try.html


### functionals

functionals extract common patterns of loop use

# explain this syntax for removing zero length list elements
my_list <- list('a', 2, integer(0))
my_list[lapply(my_list, length)>0]


# apply functions

create exercise to convert for loop to apply call

with(PlantGrowth, tapply(weight, group, sem))

from:
http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html
x <- list(1:3, 4:9, 10:12)
sapply(x, "[", 2)
#> [1]  2  5 11

# equivalent to
sapply(x, function(x) x[2])
#> [1]  2  5 11

http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functionals.html

sapply() is a thin wrapper around lapply() that transforms a list into a vector in the final step

sapply() silently returns a list if the function returns results of different types or lengths
vapply() will throw an error

sapply() guesses the output type
vapply() takes an additional argument of output type
use sapply() interactively 
use vapply() inside other functions

good examples
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15733518/efficient-way-to-loop-in-r?rq=1

Wickham Split Apply Combine for Data Analysis

Higher-order functions - apply functions
takes one or more functions as an input - outputs a function
The map function is an example of a higher-order function.
The apply function is the most basic of R's map functions. 
apply takes as arguments an array, a vector of the dimension to map along and a function. 

split and apply example:
http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/05/tricky-interview-questions/
a <- c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2)
b <- c(10,12,15,12,NA,30,42,38,40)
s <- split(b,a)
