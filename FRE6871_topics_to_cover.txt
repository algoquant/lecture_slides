### replies

I'm already supervising two capstone projects in the Spring 2017 semester, so I can't supervise another project now.
I may be able to supervise capstone projects later in the year, but the requirement is strong programming skills in either Python or C++.
Maybe you can contact me at the end of the Spring 2017 semester, if you're still interested.

I added you to NYU Classes. 
Have you used the R language?
If you haven't taken the course FRE6871 R in Finance, then I encourage you to attend classes.
Have you taken courses by prof. Song Tang?

FRE6123 Financial Risk Management and Asset Pricing
FRE6083 Quantitative Methods in Finance

For FRE-6871 R in Finance I need a grader.  The GA's responsibilities will be grading and answering student questions during office hours.
Preference is for student who has already taken FRE-6871, or who has strong R programming skills.

+ [ ] add slides for shiny::runExample()
C:\Users\Jerzy\Documents\R\win-library\3.4\shiny\examples

+ [ ] explain that there are at least two sources of the standard errors of VaR and CVaR
The first source is the finite sample size when VaR and CVaR are calculated in a simulation.
Demonstrate that when the confidence level is very high, the finite sample size causes the standard errors to become as large as the VaR and CVaR themselves.
The second source is the uncertainty of the model parameters, like the default probabilities or recovery rates (LGD).

+ [ ] to speed up Rcpp calculations avoid making copies of input matrices and vectors by passing pointers to them, and modify matrices in place
The code: 
my_func(arma::vec& vec_tor)
passes a pointer instead of making a copy
Arguments in C++ are by default passed by value, which means C++ makes a copy of x before running your function. 
To avoid this unnecessary copy pass a pointer instead of making a copy
instead of:
my_func(arma::vec vec_tor)
The code with "const" prevents C++ from changing the input data: 
my_func(const arma::vec& vec_tor)

+ [ ] demonstrate the use of sweep() for matrix multiplication

+ [ ] slide explaining what is R and how to best use it
R is a computational environment, rather than a programming language.
R is a high-level language written in C++, designed for statistical data analysis.
R is best suited for quick analysis and for prototyping code. 
R is best suited for writing short interactive scripts which call C++ or Javascript programs.
R is best suited as a hub for interacting with other programs, like numerical C++ libraries, interactive Javascript plotting and display programs, databases, etc.
But R is relatively slow, so it's not suitable for writing long programs.
If your program requires writing hundreds of lines of code, then it's better to write it in C++ or Python, and then call it from R.
R frees the user from having to perform mundane basic tasks like memory allocation, type declarations, etc., but this requires a very complex system to handle those basic tasks.
Runtime errors in R are very hard to understand, because they expose the user to the underlying complexity of the R language.

+ [ ] slide explaining why study R
Students should want to take this course despite the fact that it is hard because getting a quant job is even harder.
R and Python are the two main languages for data science and machine learning.
R is used widely used by some of the smartest and best financial quant analysts.
Provide student feedback from SurveyMonkey.

the default path is the first of these.
You can override that via an argument to both install.packages() (from inside R) or R CMD INSTALL (outside R).

TUVM Thank You Very Much!

I would like to ask you a favor.  Quantnet has issued their 2017 rankings of the best financial engineering programs.  NYU Tandon ranked 13 out of 30 programs, which is not bad, but not great either: 
https://www.quantnet.com/mfe-programs-rankings/

At the same time, NYU Tandon has received some very harsh comments, and not all of them are objective:
https://www.quantnet.com/resources/nyu-tandon-school-of-engineering-ms-in-financial-engineering.17/

I think that the biased, negative comments are a disservice to potential students, who are looking for information about programs, so they can make a good choice.  So it would be very useful to have more objective comments on this website:
https://www.quantnet.com/resources/nyu-tandon-school-of-engineering-ms-in-financial-engineering.17/

Could you write an anonymous post with your comments?
What were your favorite courses and instructors?
What courses are missing?  Python?  Statistics?  Derivatives?
What would you improve in the program?
How would you improve the job placement process? 

I'm not asking for you to write a favorable review, just an objective one that contains valuable information for potential students, and feedback for the faculty so that they can improve the program.

Thank you, you are very welcome. 
I appreciate you recommending my courses to other students.
Thank you very much for your kind words, and for your hard work!
I'll be happy to provide a letter of reference for you.

Are you proficient with the R language?


# Assignments
You can click on the Assignments tab on the left, view the homework or test file, download it, and finally submit your files from there.

Dear Students,
Welcome to FRE6871 R in Finance.  Please see attached the syllabus. 
I'm glad to see that so many students have registered for this course.  In this course you'll learn the R language, and also how to apply it to finance, like modelling interest rate yield curves using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), building credit scoring models using logistic regression, and pricing options using Monte Carlo simulation.
But I must warn you that many students find this course to be difficult, because the R language is considered to be challenging.  So this course requires good programming skills, and students should therefore have some programming experience with either the R language, or other languages such as C++ or Python.

The course FRE6871 R in Finance is designed as an introduction to R, while FRE7241 Algorithmic Portfolio Management is designed as a followup course for teaching applications of R to portfolio management.  I recommend taking the courses sequentially, first FRE6871 and then FRE7241.

Dear Students,
Please take the following free Datacamp interactive course "Introduction to R":

https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r

After you finish the course, you should receive a certificate file from Datacamp.  You can also go to your DataCamp profile page, and scroll to the bottom, where you will see an icon to the courses you finished, and a link that allows you to download the Datacamp certificate file.
Please submit the certificate file to NYU Classes.  It will be due Monday, Sep. 12th, at 12:00 PM.


Dear Students,
Thank you for your hard work in FRE-6871 R in Finance.  I hope your knowledge of R and the new topics in finance you have learned will help advance your career.

I hope you can take FRE-7241 Algorithmic Portfolio Management, which I will be teaching in the first half of Fall 2018.  This course will apply the R language to portfolio management, and will be a great opportunity to apply what you've learned in FRE-6871.

Dear Students,
I'm scheduling a make-up class because there are four lectures left in this course, but only three weeks left in the Semester.
I plan to deliver lectures on the following dates:  Nov. 21st, Nov. 24th, Dec. 1st, and Dec. 8th.
There will be a lecture on Monday Nov. 24th, as usual.

Dear Students,
I would like to schedule a make-up class this Friday, Nov 21st from 6PM to 9PM.  Please let me know if this is inconvenient for you.

Dear Students,
The Teaching Assistant is Xirui (Sherry) He (xh521@nyu.edu).
Please email all homeworks and tests to Sherry He.

Dear Students,

# email grading

You received one of the lowest scores, so I think that your final grade of B- is generous and fair.
Most students received very high scores.  You had low scores on two tests.  Your score was close to the median of other scores, so I think that your final grade of B+ is generous and fair.
Course letter grades were derived from the cumulative scores, but there was no fixed formula.  Most students received quite high scores.  Your score was below the median of other scores, so I think that your final grade of B+ is generous and fair.
Thank you for your kind words, and best of luck.


# email to Dawei,
The way to improve your programming skills is by running the lecture code in an R session, analyzing it, and modifying it to better understand how it works (experimenting with the lecture code).  Unfortunately not enough students ask me in class about the lecture code, which must mean that either they find the lecture code totally clear, or they haven't studied it as part of their homework assignments.

The purpose of this course is to teach students how to analyze existing code, and how to adapt it to solve new problems.  This means that you will have to write new code by combining and modifying existing code.  By its nature this can be very challenging.

I carefully design the tests so they can be solved by combining and modifying existing code lecture code.  If you find that some test solutions require code that is unrelated to the lecture code, then please alert me to them.

I have taken your suggestion and provided more detailed instructions for the upcoming test, so that you can start solving the test assignments ahead of time.  I will also provide hints during the test, to guide you along.

The course will have six tests in total, so you still have a chance to improve your average tests scores if you perform well on future tests.


# email

Dear Students,
So there will be no class on Oct. 28.  The first class will be on Tuesday Nov 4th.

# email for test:

Dear Students,
Please install packages: moments, ggplot2, gridExtra, wordcloud

Dear Students,
There will be an in-class test this Monday, September 26th. 
The test will start at 6:30 PM, and will last 60min until 7:30 PM.
I will upload the test file at 6:30PM to NYU Classes.
The lecture will start at 6:00 PM, as usual.  
You must bring your laptops and be able to log into WiFi.

The test will be based on lecture notes, so please study the topics below:

Classifying numeric data into categories according to breakpoints using function findInterval().
Splitting data frames according to categories using function split().
Performing the split-apply-combine procedure using function sapply() and an anonymous function. 
Study slide 38 "The lapply() Functional" in the functions.pdf, and slide 39 "The sapply() Functional", and analyze the code.
Plotting scatterplots using functions plot(), points(), and text().
Creating wrapper functions designed to validate their arguments.
Performing for(), apply(), and sapply() loops over matrices and data frames. 
Performing while loops instead of for() loops. 

You will be required to create a wrapper for function sum(), called sum_rob(), which performs validation of its dots "..." argument, and returns NULL if the argument isn't valid. 
The function sum_rob() should accept the same arguments as function sum(): dots "..." argument and "na.rm=FALSE". 

The function sum_rob() should validate its dots "..." argument to check that it's either a numeric atomic object, or a list containing numeric objects, and return its sum.  
If it's neither, then it should return NULL.
The function sum_rob() should pass its "na.rm" argument to the "na.rm" argument of function sum(). 

There are many ways of implementing function sum_rob().
You can use functions list(), unlist(), is.list(), is.numeric(), length(), c(), do.call(), return(), and sum().

Call sum_rob() as follows, to verify that it works correctly.
You should get the following results:

sum_rob(1:9)
#   [1] 45
sum_rob(matrix(1:9, 3))
#   [1] 45
sum_rob(list(1:9, 3))
#   [1] 48
sum_rob(1, 2, 3, NA)
#   [1] NA
sum_rob(1, 2, 3, NA, na.rm=TRUE)
#   [1] 6
sum_rob(1, 2, 3:5, NA, na.rm=TRUE)
#   [1] 15
sum_rob(iris[, 4])
#   [1] 179.9
sum_rob(iris[, 5])
# NULL
sum_rob("a")
# NULL
sum_rob(list(1, 2, 3))
#   [1] 6
sum_rob(list(1, 2, 3, NA))
#   [1] NA
sum_rob(list(1, 2, 3, NA), na.rm=TRUE)
#   [1] 6
sum_rob(list(1, 2, 3, "a"))
#   NULL



Subsetting data frames using logical operators. 
Using function which() to extract elements of data frames. 
Using anonymous functions in apply() loops. 
Omitting NA values in loops. 
Performing vectorized operations over vectors, matrices, and data frames.
Benchmarking the CPU time used by R operations using package microbenchmark.

you will be using the student_scores data frame from homework #3 

Plotting histograms
Calculating contingency tables. 
reading files containing bad data elements,
coercing data frames and factors to numeric,

### grading and partial credit policies

The reason that the student's code may not reproduce the exact expected values, is because they didn't reset the random number generator.
In that case you need to analyze their code to determine if it's correct or not.
The most important criterion is if the student's code makes basic sense, or if they're lost.  You have to make that judgement.  
Feel free to ask me for advice in specific cases.

You can be generous with awarding partial credit, even when the student's code doesn't reproduce the exact expected values, as long as the code is basically correct, except for some minor errors.

The homeworks and tests contain several parts, with each part assigned a maximum score. 
Please grade each part separately, assign it a numerical score, and add up all the scores to get the total homework or test score.
Enter the total scores for the homeworks and tests into the attached spreadsheet.  

Write the actual scores next to the maximum scores in the students' *.R files, and email them back to students.  But wait until after the deadline and after all students have submitted their *.R files
Please let me know when you've received all the homeworks each week after they're due so that I may post the solutions.

# Please apply the following partial credit grading policies.
Paste the students' code into an R session to verify that it produces the correct answer (output).
Maximum scores should be given only for complete code that follows the instructions, and that produces the correct answer when pasted into an R session.  Sometimes students are required to use specific functions.  In that case you should inspect their code to verify that they used those specific functions.  The students' code doesn't have to be exactly the same as the solution code, since many different solutions are often possible.
Give partial credit equal to about 2/3 of max score for code that is almost right: it doesn't produce the correct answer, but produces a slightly different answer due to minor errors.  Give partial credit of about 1/3 of max score for code that has several major errors (wrong function or variable), but that has some correct code that can be useful for producing the correct answer.  Give zero score for code that's completely incorrect and useless for producing the correct answer.

# Instructions for homeworks and tests.
Sometimes the instructions require you to use specific functions to write your solutions.
When the instructions say "You can use the functions ..." it is just a suggestion to help you.  You can use any functions you choose, as long as your code produces the correct answer (output).
When the instructions say "You must use the functions ..." it means you must use the specific functions.  You won't get full credit if you don't use the specified functions.

# Plagiarism
Students are allowed to copy code from course slides, books, or any online sources.  But students must provide references to any external sources from which they copy code (such as links, or titles and page numbers).
Students are not allowed to copy code from each other.  Please alert me if you see that different students have submitted close to identical code.

### homework and test ideas

+ [ ] perform double barrier simulation using vectorized functions

+ [x] Calculate the standard errors of the standard deviation and the median absolute deviation (MAD) estimators for VTI, using parallel bootstrap and antithetic sampling

+ [ ] Add to "Download data from FRED for rates" - add bad symbols and download in while loop from FRED, just like Tiingo
Add a bad symbol to list of symbols and download data in lapply loop using getSymbols()
Wrap getSymbols() in trycatch() 

+ [ ] perform t-test for a large sample and improve speed
adapt from Case study: t-test:
http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Profiling.html#t-test

+ [ ] in the existing test: Perform logistic regression to forecast if a subject is a student or not,
Split the dataset and perform the forecast out-of-sample.

+ [ ] Perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the price of a barrier option 
One type of barrier option is a knock-out (down and out) call option.
The knock-out call option pays out the positive difference between the final price minus the strike, but only if the intermediate price never falls bellow the knock-out price.
Perform bootstrap simulation to estimate the standard error of the estimated price.
Apply antithetic sampling to the barrier option simulation to reduce the standard errors.
First write a while() loop and run it in parallel with parLapply()
Then create a fully vectorized version using function matrixStats::colCumsums().
Finally write the code using RcppArmadillo.

+ [ ] reproduce function matrixStats::colCumsums() using RcppArmadillo

+ [ ] same as above: Calculate the standard errors of the quantiles for the normal distribution, using Monte Carlo simulation - needs more work
Demonstrate that for the normal distribution, the standard errors of the higher quantiles increases relative to their value (higher moments are increasingly noisy).
Perform bootstrap in parallel to estimate the standard errors.
Therefore measuring risk at a higher confidence interval is useless.
Demonstrate that when the confidence level is very high, the finite sample size causes the standard errors to become as large as the VaR and CVaR themselves.

+ [ ] create an Rcpp function that multiplies a vector by a number

+ [ ] perform split-apply-combine procedure using the first column of a matrix
# Create synthetic data
vec_tor <- sample(1:5, 20, replace=TRUE)
mat_rix <- matrix(runif(40), nc=2)
mat_rix <- cbind(vec_tor, mat_rix)
# calculate sum-products of sub-matrix columns
sapply(X=unique(mat_rix[, 1]), FUN=function(x) {
  foo <- mat_rix[which(mat_rix[, 1] == x), -1,  drop=FALSE]
  sum(apply(foo, 1, prod))
})  # end sapply

+ [ ] needs more work to simulate many random samples: 
simulate two vectors of random normal data with slightly different means, and calculate the distribution of p-values of the t-test, Wilcoxon-test, and the KS-test as a function of the difference in the means.
Calculate the p-value distributions for equal means, and then calculate the Type I and Type II error rates. 
Calculate the classifier sensitivity, i.e. the percentage of positives correctly classified as positives.
Calculate the classifier specificity, i.e. the percentage of negatives correctly classified as negatives.
Repeat for slightly different means.

+ [ ] 
a <- c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2)
b <- c(10,12,15,12,NA,30,42,38,40)
s <- split(b, a)
lapply(s, mean, na.rm=TRUE)

+ [x] Scrub a vector of symbols to remove duplicates

+ [x] Replace the first and third columns of a matrix, using only subsetting and the function c()

+ [x] Subset elements of a list of vectors, and extract the second element of each list element using "["

+ [ ] permutation puzzle
C:\Develop\R\scripts\permutations.R

+ [ ] coin flips puzzle
C:\Develop\R\scripts\coin_flips.R

+ [ ] create R code with errors and ask students to fix them:
install.packages(zoo)
foo <- as.list(1:11)

read data from file in lapply loop
file has bad data and loop bombs
assignment:
fix loop using tryCatch
lapply loop returns list
flatten list to zoo

+ [ ] calling nested functions with dots '...' argument before or after dots

+ [ ] functional called by sapply loop takes dots '...' argument and passes dots to function
sapply passes argument to functional

vapply(LETTERS[1:3], function(x) {x == "B"}, logical(1)) # F, T, F
vapply(LETTERS[0], function(x) {x == "B"}, logical(1))   # logical()

### R environment

set R_PROFILE variable

setting up .RProfile file
customizations


.Rprofile file shouldn't include any code that affects the results of programs, as this would make them irreproducible for other users.
.Rprofile file shouldn't load packages, change the options of functions, define functions etc. 
Instead, add an initialization script at the top level of every project file
R code should be self-contained and reproducible 

special functions
.First
.Last

.Rprofile file can include code that changes the appearance of R:

# describing options() params
# set global options
options()
# get global options
getOption()

example:
option_values <- options()  # get all global options
length(option_values)
head(option_values)
tail(option_values)
options("digits")
options(digits=3)

# set wide display for multiple monitors
options(width=160)

getOption("max.print")
options("max.print")
options(max.print=100)

# set default CRAN mirror
options(repos=c(CRAN="http://cran.rstudio.com")))

# set prompt
options(prompt="R", digits=4, show.signif.stars=FALSE)

# customize windows graphics defaults
setHook(packageEvent("grDevices", "onLoad"),
        function(...)
            grDevices::windows.options(width=8, height=6,
                                       xpos=0, pointsize=10,

###


# style guide
I follow Hadley Wickham's style guide, with some small exceptions.
I liked your points about using whitespace to enhance readability and shorten length of lines.

I personally dislike the '<-' assignment operator, but I still use it in R, instead of '='.  The reason is that the two assignment operators are not equivalent in R.
The '<-' and '=' operators differ in scope and precedence ('<-' has higher precedence than '=')

The '=' operator is used for named arguments in function calls.

As a rule of thumb, I use '<-' in R scripts, and I use '=' in function calls.

If I had a choice, I would completely eliminate the '<-' assignment operator.


### Control statements

inside if() statements almost always use '||' and '&&'


use this:
my_var <- if (my_clause) A.expression else B.expression

instead of this:
if (my_clause) {
my_var <- A.expression
} else {
my_var <- B.expression
}

# rewrite above using apply

# even better:
character.to.binary <- function(x) {
  switch(x, Yes=1, No=0, NA)

binary.married <- sapply(married, character.to.binary)

# Proportion of respondents married
mean(binary.married[binary.married != ""])

# for large n, better to create transpose, column by column, instead of row by row:

captures all output sent to the standard output and returns a character vector where each element correspond to a line of output.
capture.output() 
it does not capture the output sent to the standard error, e.g. cat("Hello\nworld!\n", file=stderr()) and message("Hello\nworld!\n").
it is very slow

UseMethod()
When a function calling UseMethod("fun") is applied to an object with class attribute c("first", "second"), the system searches for a function called fun.first and, if it finds it, applies it to the object. 
If no such function is found a function called fun.second is tried. 
If no class name produces a suitable function, the function fun.default is used, if it exists, or an error results.

### function operators

# functions that have functions as arguments
http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functionals.html


incoroporate rollmedian() example

A function operator is a function that takes one (or more) functions as input and returns a function as output.
function operators are similar to functionals
function operators extract common patterns of anonymous function use


# Functional Programming using Map and Reduce

Map()
Reduce()
Filter()

Map() computes two or more lists (or data frames) in parallel
Map() is a variant of lapply(), where all arguments can vary
Map() is equivalent to mapply with simplify=FALSE


match.fun()
call a function 'func'
call_fun <- function(func, ...) func(...)

# lists of functions
http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html

lapply(compute_mean, function(f) system.time(f(x)))

Replacement function replace() - not sure it's important

Sikai> So my question is, how does match.arg() work in this function?
The function match.arg() has a second argument called "choices", which must be a character vector containing the only possible values for the first argument "arg".
When match.arg() is called inside a functional, and if that functional has default values for the argument "arg", then R passes those default values to the argument "choices".  This way only one of the default values for "arg" are permitted to be assigned to "arg".
In order to find out how R does this internally would require analyzing the code for match.arg() and probably several other functions.
