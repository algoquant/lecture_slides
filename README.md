### This repository contains the pdf files with the lecture slides for my two graduate courses at NYU Tandon:

+ [FRE7241 Algorithmic Portfolio Management (link)](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/finance-and-risk-engineering/fre-course-listings)

+ [FRE6871 R in Finance (link)](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/finance-and-risk-engineering/fre-course-listings)


There are two types of pdf files.  First, there are thematic pdf files, with slides on certain topics.  For example, the file portfolio_construction.pdf contains slides about portfolio risk measurement and investment strategies.  Second, there are lecture files, with slides for specific lectures.  For example, the file FRE7241_Lecture_1.pdf contains slides for the first lecture of FRE7241.  The individual lecture files are assembled from slides taken from the thematic pdf files.

The repository also contains the Sweave source files (in LaTeX format, extension .Rnw) for creating the pdf files.  The pdf files were compiled from the Sweave files, and also from the data and image files, using the package knitr.  The data files are too large and are not included.

There are also .R files containing the code from the lecture slides, so that students can execute the code as they listen to the lecture. 


If you would like to obtain all the lecture materials, including large RData and csv files with sample data, then please send me your email address to jp3900@nyu.edu, and I will send you a link to my repo.
