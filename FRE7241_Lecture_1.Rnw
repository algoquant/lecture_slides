      My name is Jerzy Pawlowski \href{mailto:jp3900@nyu.edu}{jp3900@nyu.edu}
      \vskip1ex
      I'm an adjunct professor at NYU Tandon because I love teaching and I want to share my professional knowledge with young, enthusiastic students.
      \vskip1ex
      I'm interested in applications of \emph{machine learning} to \emph{systematic investing}.
      \vskip1ex
      I'm an advocate of \emph{open-source software}, and I share it on GitHub:\\
      \href{https://github.com/algoquant/}{\color{blue}{My GitHub account}} 
      \vskip1ex
      In my finance career, I have worked as a hedge fund \emph{portfolio manager}, \emph{CLO structurer} (banker), and \emph{quant analyst}.\\

\subsection{FRE7241 Course Description and Objectives}
\begin{frame}[t]{\subsecname}
\vspace{-2em}

\begin{block}{Course Description}
The course will apply the \texttt{R} programming language to \emph{momentum trading}, \emph{statistical arbitrage} (pairs trading), and other active portfolio management strategies.  The course will implement volatility and price \emph{forecasting models}, asset pricing and \emph{factor models}, and \emph{portfolio optimization}.  The course will apply \emph{machine learning} techniques, such as \emph{backtesting} (cross-validation) and \emph{parameter regularization} (shrinkage).
\end{block}
\pause

\begin{block}{Course Objectives}
Students will learn through \texttt{R} coding exercises how to:\\
\hskip1em - download data from external sources, and to scrub and format it.\\
\hskip1em - estimate time series parameters, and fit models such as \emph{ARIMA}, \emph{GARCH}, and factor models.\\
\hskip1em - optimize portfolios under different constraints and risk-return objectives.\\
\hskip1em - backtest active portfolio management strategies and evaluate their performance.\\
\end{block}
\pause

\begin{block}{Course Prerequisites}
  \emph{FRE6123 Financial Risk Management and Asset Pricing}.  The \texttt{R} language is considered to be challenging, so this course requires programming experience with other languages such as \texttt{C++} or \texttt{Python}.  Students with less programming experience are encouraged to first take \emph{FRE6871 R in Finance}, and also \emph{FRE6883 Financial Computing} by prof. Song Tang.  Students should also have knowledge of basic statistics (random variables, estimators, hypothesis testing, regression, etc.)
\end{block}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Homeworks and Tests}
\begin{frame}[t]{\subsecname}
\vspace{-1em}

\begin{block}{Homeworks and Tests}
Grading will be based on homeworks and in-class tests.  There will be no final exam.
      \vskip1ex
The tests will require writing code, which should run directly when pasted into an \texttt{R} session, and should produce the required output, without any modifications.
      \vskip1ex
Students will be allowed to consult lecture slides, and to copy code from them, and to copy from books or any online sources, but they will be required to provide references to those external sources (such as links or titles and page numbers).
      \vskip1ex
The tests will be closely based on code contained in the lecture slides, so students are encouraged to become very familiar with those slides.
      \vskip1ex
Students will submit their homework and test files only through \emph{NYU Classes} (not emails).
      \vskip1ex
Students will be required to bring their laptop computers to class and run the \texttt{R} Interpreter, and the \texttt{RStudio} Integrated Development Environment (\emph{IDE}), during the lecture.
      \vskip1ex
Homeworks will also include reading assignments designed to help prepare for tests.
\end{block}
\pause

\begin{block}{Graduate Assistant}
The graduate assistant (GA) will be Jed Lu \href{mailto:jl9445@nyu.edu}{jl9445@nyu.edu}.\\
The GA will answer questions during office hours, or via \emph{NYU Classes} forums, not via emails.  Please send emails regarding lecture matters from \emph{NYU Classes} (not personal emails).
\end{block}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Tips for Solving Homeworks and Tests}
\begin{frame}[t]{\subsecname}
\vspace{-1em}
  \begin{block}{Tips for Solving Homeworks and Tests}
    The tests will require mostly copying code samples from the lecture slides, making some modifications to them, and combining them with other code samples.
    \vskip1ex
    Partial credit will be given even for code that doesn't produce the correct output, but that has elements of code that can be useful for producing the right answer.
    \vskip1ex
    So don't leave test assignments unanswered, and instead copy any code samples from the lecture slides that are related to the solution and make sense.
    \vskip1ex
    Contact the GA during office hours via text or phone, and submit questions to the GA or to me via \emph{NYU Classes}.
  \end{block}
\pause
  \begin{block}{Please Submit \emph{Minimal Working Examples} With Your Questions}
    When submitting questions, please provide a \emph{minimal working example} that produces the error in \texttt{R}, with the following items:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The \emph{complete} \texttt{R} code that produces the error, including the seed value for random numbers,
        \item The version of \texttt{R} (output of command: \texttt{sessionInfo()}), and the versions of \texttt{R} packages, 
        \item The type and version of your operating system (Windows or OSX),
        \item The dataset file used by the \texttt{R} code,
        \item The text or screenshots of error messages,
      \end{itemize}
    \vskip1ex
    You can read more about producing \emph{minimal working examples} here:
      \url{http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve}\\
      \url{http://www.jaredknowles.com/journal/2013/5/27/writing-a-minimal-working-example-mwe-in-r}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Course Grading Policies}
\begin{frame}[t]{\subsecname}
\vspace{-1em}

\begin{block}{Numerical Scores}
  Tests will be graded and assigned numerical scores.  
  Each part of the tests will be graded separately and assigned a numerical score.\\
  Maximum scores will be given only for complete code, that produces the correct output when it's pasted into an \texttt{R} session, without any modifications. 
  As long as the \texttt{R} code uses the required functions and produces the correct output, it will be given full credit.\\
  Partial credit will be given even for code that doesn't produce the correct output, but that has elements of code that can be useful for producing the right answer.
\end{block}
\pause

\begin{block}{Plagiarism}
  Plagiarism (copying from other students) and cheating will be punished.\\
  But copying code from lecture slides, books, or any online sources is allowed and encouraged.\\
  Students must provide references to any external sources from which they copy code (such as links or titles and page numbers).
\end{block}
\pause

\begin{block}{Letter Grades}
  Letter grades for the course will be derived from the cumulative scores obtained for all the tests.  Very high numerical scores close to the maximum won't guarantee an A letter grade, since grading will also depend on the difficulty of the assignments.
\end{block}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{FRE7241 Course Materials}
\begin{frame}[t]{\subsecname}
\vspace{-1em}

\begin{block}{Lecture Slides}
The course will be mostly self-contained, using detailed lecture slides containing extensive, working \texttt{R} code examples.\\
The course will also utilize data and tutorials which are freely available on the internet.
\end{block}
\pause

    \texttt{R} is more difficult than other languages because:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{R} is a \emph{functional} language, which makes its syntax unfamiliar to users of procedural languages like \texttt{C/C++}.
      \item The huge number of user-created \emph{packages} makes it difficult to tell which are the best for particular applications.
      \item \texttt{R} can produce very cryptic \emph{warning} and \emph{error} messages, because it's a programming environment, so it performs many operations quietly, but those can sometimes fail.
      \item Fixing errors usually requires analyzing the complex structure of the \texttt{R} programming environment.

      A popular probability \emph{tilting} method is exponential (Esscher) tilting:

    \column{0.5\textwidth}
      The \emph{bootstrap} procedure performs a loop, which naturally lends itself to parallel computing.
      \vskip1ex
      Different functions from package \emph{parallel} need to be called depending on the operating system (\emph{Windows}, \emph{Mac-OSX}, or \emph{Linux}).
      \vskip1ex
      The function \texttt{makeCluster()} starts running \texttt{R} processes on several CPU cores under \emph{Windows}.
      \vskip1ex
      The function \texttt{parLapply()} is similar to \texttt{lapply()}, and performs loops under \emph{Windows} using parallel computing on several CPU cores.
      \vskip1ex
      The \texttt{R} processes started by \texttt{makeCluster()} don't inherit any data from the parent \texttt{R} process.
      \vskip1ex
      Therefore the required data must be passed into \texttt{parLapply()} via the dots \texttt{"..."} argument.
      \vskip1ex
      The function \texttt{mclapply()} performs loops using parallel computing on several CPU cores under \emph{Mac-OSX} or \emph{Linux}.
      \vskip1ex
      The function \texttt{stopCluster()} stops the \texttt{R} processes running on several CPU cores.
