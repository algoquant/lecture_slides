      I'm an adjunct professor at NYU Tandon because I love teaching and I want to share my professional knowledge with young, enthusiastic students.
      \vskip1ex
      I'm interested in applications of \emph{machine learning} to \emph{systematic investing}.
      \vskip1ex
      I'm an advocate of \emph{open-source software}, and I share it on GitHub:\\

\subsection{FRE7241 Course Description and Objectives}
\begin{frame}[t]{\subsecname}
\vspace{-2em}

\begin{block}{Course Description}
The course will apply the \texttt{R} programming language to \emph{momentum trading}, \emph{statistical arbitrage} (pairs trading), and other active portfolio management strategies.  The course will implement volatility and price \emph{forecasting models}, asset pricing and \emph{factor models}, and \emph{portfolio optimization}.  The course will apply \emph{machine learning} techniques, such as \emph{backtesting} (cross-validation) and \emph{parameter regularization} (shrinkage).
\end{block}
\pause

\begin{block}{Course Objectives}
Students will learn through \texttt{R} coding exercises how to:\\
\hskip1em - download data from external sources, and to scrub and format it.\\
\hskip1em - estimate time series parameters, and fit models such as \emph{ARIMA}, \emph{GARCH}, and factor models.\\
\hskip1em - optimize portfolios under different constraints and risk-return objectives.\\
\hskip1em - backtest active portfolio management strategies and evaluate their performance.\\
\hskip1em - paper-trade strategies in Interactive Brokers.
\end{block}
\pause

\begin{block}{Course Prerequisites}
  \emph{FRE6123 Financial Risk Management and Asset Pricing}.  The \texttt{R} language is considered to be challenging, so this course requires programming experience with other languages such as \texttt{C++} or \texttt{Python}.  Students with less programming experience are encouraged to first take \emph{FRE6871 R in Finance}, and also \emph{FRE6883 Financial Computing} by prof. Song Tang.  Students should also have knowledge of basic statistics (random variables, estimators, hypothesis testing, regression, etc.)
\end{block}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Homeworks and Tests}
\begin{frame}[t]{\subsecname}
\vspace{-1em}

\begin{block}{Homeworks and Tests}
Grading will be based on homeworks and in-class tests.  There will be no final exam.
      \vskip1ex
The tests will require writing code, which should run directly when pasted into an \texttt{R} session, and should produce the required output, without any modifications.
      \vskip1ex
Students will be allowed to consult lecture slides, and to copy code from them, and to copy from books or any online sources, but they will be required to provide references to those external sources (such as links or titles and page numbers).
      \vskip1ex
The tests will be closely based on code contained in the lecture slides, so students are encouraged to become very familiar with those slides.
      \vskip1ex
Students will submit their homework and test files only through \emph{NYU Classes} (not emails).
      \vskip1ex
Students will be required to bring their laptop computers to class and run the \texttt{R} Interpreter, and the \texttt{RStudio} Integrated Development Environment (\emph{IDE}), during the lecture.
      \vskip1ex
Homeworks will also include reading assignments designed to help prepare for tests.
\end{block}
\pause

\begin{block}{Graduate Assistant}
The graduate assistant (GA) will be Jed Lu \href{mailto:jl9445@nyu.edu}{jl9445@nyu.edu}.\\
The GA will answer questions during office hours, or via \emph{NYU Classes} forums, not via emails.  Please send emails regarding lecture matters from \emph{NYU Classes} (not personal emails).
\end{block}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Tips for Solving Homeworks and Tests}
\begin{frame}[t]{\subsecname}
\vspace{-1em}
  \begin{block}{Tips for Solving Homeworks and Tests}
    The tests will require mostly copying code samples from the lecture slides, making some modifications to them, and combining them with other code samples.
    \vskip1ex
    Partial credit will be given even for code that doesn't produce the correct output, but that has elements of code that can be useful for producing the right answer.
    \vskip1ex
    So don't leave test assignments unanswered, and instead copy any code samples from the lecture slides that are related to the solution and make sense.
    \vskip1ex
    Contact the GA during office hours via text or phone, and submit questions to the GA or to me via \emph{NYU Classes}.
  \end{block}
\pause
  \begin{block}{Please Submit \emph{Minimal Working Examples} With Your Questions}
    When submitting questions, please provide a \emph{minimal working example} that produces the error in \texttt{R}, with the following items:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The \emph{complete} \texttt{R} code that produces the error, including the seed value for random numbers,
        \item The version of \texttt{R} (output of command: \texttt{sessionInfo()}), and the versions of \texttt{R} packages, 
        \item The type and version of your operating system (Windows or OSX),
        \item The dataset file used by the \texttt{R} code,
        \item The text or screenshots of error messages,
      \end{itemize}
    \vskip1ex
    You can read more about producing \emph{minimal working examples} here:

  \end{block}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Course Grading Policies}
\begin{frame}[t]{\subsecname}
\vspace{-1em}

\begin{block}{Numerical Scores}
  Tests will be graded and assigned numerical scores.  
  Each part of the tests will be graded separately and assigned a numerical score.\\
  Maximum scores will be given only for complete code, that produces the correct output when it's pasted into an \texttt{R} session, without any modifications. 
  As long as the \texttt{R} code uses the required functions and produces the correct output, it will be given full credit.\\
  Partial credit will be given even for code that doesn't produce the correct output, but that has elements of code that can be useful for producing the right answer.
\end{block}
\pause

\begin{block}{Plagiarism}
  Plagiarism (copying from other students) and cheating will be punished.\\
  But copying code from lecture slides, books, or any online sources is allowed and encouraged.\\
  Students must provide references to any external sources from which they copy code (such as links or titles and page numbers).
\end{block}
\pause

\begin{block}{Letter Grades}
  Letter grades for the course will be derived from the cumulative scores obtained for all the tests.  Very high numerical scores close to the maximum won't guarantee an A letter grade, since grading will also depend on the difficulty of the assignments.
\end{block}

\end{frame}

  - Use the left arrow \texttt{"<-"} for assignment, not the equals sign \texttt{"="} (to insert \texttt{"<-"} into code, use the \emph{Alt-underscore} shortcut in Windows),\\
  - Use \emph{nouns} for variable names and \emph{verbs} for function names,\\
  - Use a combination of lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores \texttt{"\_"} for names of variables and functions,\\
  - Add underscores \texttt{"\_"} to names to avoid conflicts with the names of existing \texttt{R} functions and variables,\\
  - Do not use dots \texttt{"."} in names, except in the names of function \emph{methods} (even though \texttt{R} uses them for variables as well),\\
  - Use underscores \texttt{"\_"} in file names, instead of spaces,\\
  - Always put a space after a comma, never before it: \texttt{"x, y"} not \texttt{"x , y"},\\
  - Do not put spaces inside or outside parentheses: \texttt{"if (x > 0)"} not \texttt{"if ( x > 0 )"},\\
  - Surround infix operators (\texttt{==, +, -, <-,} etc.) with spaces: \texttt{"x > 0"} not \texttt{"x>0"} (even though I don't always follow that rule, to save whitespace),\\
  - Add a comment after the closing curly bracket: \texttt{"\}  \# end my\_fun"},

    \texttt{R} is more difficult than other languages because:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{R} is a \emph{functional} language, which makes its syntax unfamiliar to users of procedural languages like \texttt{C/C++}.
      \item The huge number of user-created \emph{packages} makes it difficult to tell which are the best for particular applications.
      \item \texttt{R} can produce very cryptic \emph{warning} and \emph{error} messages, because it's a programming environment, so it performs many operations quietly, but those can sometimes fail.
      \item Fixing errors usually requires analyzing the complex structure of the \texttt{R} programming environment.

      \emph{Time series} are data objects that contain a \emph{date-time} index and data associated with it.

      The native time series class in \texttt{R} is \emph{ts}.
      \vskip1ex
      \emph{ts} time series are \emph{regular}, i.e. they can only have an equally spaced \emph{date-time} index.
      \vskip1ex
      \emph{ts} time series have a \texttt{numeric} \emph{date-time} index, usually encoded as a \emph{year-fraction}, or some other unit, like number of months, etc.
      \vskip1ex
      For example the date \texttt{"2015-03-31"} can be encoded as a \emph{year-fraction} equal to \texttt{2015.244}.

      The \emph{stats} base package contains functions for manipulating time series objects of class \emph{ts}.

      \vskip1ex
      The \texttt{frequency} argument is the number of observations per unit of time.

      The \emph{expected utility} hypothesis states that investors try to maximize the expected value of the \emph{utility} of wealth, not the expected value of the wealth.
      \vskip1ex
      In 1738 Daniel Bernoulli introduced the concept of \emph{logarithmic utility} in his work \emph{"Specimen Theoriae Novae de Mensura Sortis"} (New Theory of the Measurement of Risk).
      \vskip1ex
      The \emph{logarithmic utility} function is defined as the logarithm of wealth: $u(w) = \log(w)$.
      \vskip1ex
      Under \emph{logarithmic utility} investor preferences depend on the percentage change of wealth, instead of the absolute change of wealth: $\mathrm{d} u(w) = \frac{\mathrm{d}w}{w}$.
      \vskip1ex
      An investor with \emph{logarithmic utility} invests only a fraction $\kappa$ of their wealth in a gamble, depending on the risk-return of the gamble.
      \vskip1ex
      If the initial wealth is equal to $1$, then the expected value of \emph{logarithmic utility} for the binary gamble is equal to: $u(\kappa) = p \, \log(1 + \kappa a) + q \, \log(1 - \kappa b)$.

      The betting fraction that maximizes the \emph{utility} can be found by equating the derivative of \emph{utility} to zero:

        \kappa = \frac{p}{b}-\frac{q}{a} = \frac{p \, a - q \, b}{b \, a} = \frac{\mu}{b \, a}
      \end{displaymath}
      The optimal $\kappa$ is called the \emph{Kelly fraction}, and it depends on the parameters of the gamble.
      \vskip1ex
      The \emph{Kelly fraction} can be greater than $1$ (leveraged investing), or it can be negative (shorting).

      The \emph{Kelly fraction} is then equal to the expected payout divided by the betting odds.

      The \emph{Kelly criterion} states that investors should bet the optimal \emph{Kelly fraction} of their capital in a gamble.

      Investors with concave utility functions (for example logarithmic utility) are sensitive to the risk of ruin (losing all their capital).
      \vskip1ex
      Applying the \emph{Kelly criterion} and betting only a fraction of their capital reduces the risk of ruin (but it doesn't eliminate the risk if prices drop suddenly).
      \vskip1ex
      The loss amount $b$ determines the risk of ruin, with larger values of $b$ increasing the risk of ruin.
      \vskip1ex
      Therefore investors will choose a smaller betting fraction $\kappa$ for larger values of $b$.
      \vskip1ex
      This means that even for huge odds in their favor, investors may not choose to invest all their capital, because of the risk of ruin.

      At time $t=0$ the investor has initial \emph{wealth} equal to $1$ dollar, and they also borrow on margin $m$ dollars to invest in the risky asset.

      In order to avoid ruin, the investor may choose to maintain a fixed \emph{leverage ratio} equal to $\kappa$, so that the amount invested in the risky asset is proportional to the \emph{wealth}: $m_t = \kappa \, w_t$.
      \vskip1ex
      This requires buying the \emph{risky asset} when its price increases, and selling it when it drops.
      \vskip1ex
      The return on the risky asset in a single period is equal to: $\kappa \, w_t \, r_t$, so the \emph{terminal wealth} at time $t$ is equal to the compounded returns: 
      \begin{displaymath}
        w_t = (1 + \kappa \, r_1) \ldots (1 + \kappa \, r_t)
      \end{displaymath}
      The utility of the \emph{terminal wealth} is equal to the sum of the utilities of single periods: 
      \begin{flalign*}
        & \mathbbm{E}[\log{w_t}] = \mathbbm{E}[\log((1 + \kappa \, r_1) \ldots (1 + \kappa \, r_t))] &\\
        & = \sum_{i=1}^t {\mathbbm{E}[\log{(1 + \kappa \, r_i)}]} = t \, \mathbbm{E}[\log{(1 + \kappa \, r)}]
      \end{flalign*}
      The last equality holds because all the utilities of single periods are the same.
    \column{0.5\textwidth}
      Let the returns over a short time period be equal to $r$, with probability distribution $p(r)$.
      \vskip1ex
      The mean return $\bar{r}$, and variance $\sigma^2$ are:
      \begin{displaymath}
        \bar{r} = \int {r \, p(r) \, \mathrm{d}r} \; ; \quad
        \sigma^2 = \int {(r - \bar{r})^2 \, p(r) \, \mathrm{d}r}
      \end{displaymath}
      Since the returns are over a short time period, we have: $r \ll 1$ and $\bar{r} \ll \sigma$, so that we can replace $r - \bar{r}$ with $r$ as follows:
      \begin{displaymath}
        \int {(r - \bar{r})^2 \, p(r) \, \mathrm{d}r} \approx \int {r^2 \, p(r) \, \mathrm{d}r}

      So the utility of the \emph{terminal wealth} $u_t$ is equal to the utility of a single period times the number of periods:
      \begin{displaymath}
        u_t = \mathbbm{E}[\log{w_t}] = t \, \mathbbm{E}[\log{(1 + \kappa \, r)}] = t \, u_r
      \end{displaymath}
      The utility of the asset returns $u_r$ is equal to:
      \begin{displaymath}
        u_r = \mathbbm{E}[\log{(1 + \kappa \, r)}] = \int {\log(1 + \kappa \, r) \, p(r) \, \mathrm{d}r}
      \end{displaymath}
      The leverage $\kappa$ is limited so that $(1 + \kappa \, r) > 0$ for all return values $r$.
      \vskip1ex
      If the mean returns are positive, then at first the utility increases with leverage, but only up to a point.
      \vskip1ex
      With higher leverage, the negative utility of time periods with negative returns becomes significant, forcing the aggregate utility to drop.

      The \emph{logarithmic utility}  $u_r$ can be expanded in the moments of the return distribution:
      \begin{flalign*}
        & u_r = \mathbbm{E}[\log{(1 + \kappa \, r)}] = \int {\log(1 + \kappa \, r) \, p(r) \, \mathrm{d}r} & \\
        & = \int {(\kappa \, r - \frac{(\kappa \, r)^2}{2} + \frac{(\kappa \, r)^3}{3} - \frac{(\kappa \, r)^4}{4}) \, p(r) \, \mathrm{d}r} & \\
        & = \kappa \bar{r} - \frac{\kappa^2 \sigma^2}{2} + \frac{\kappa^3 \hat{s}}{3} - \frac{\kappa^4 \hat{k}}{4}
      \end{flalign*}
      Where $\hat{s} = \int {r^3 \, p(r) \, \mathrm{d}r}$ is the \emph{skewness}, and $\hat{k} = \int {r^4 \, p(r) \, \mathrm{d}r}$ is the \emph{kurtosis}.
      \vskip1ex
      The \emph{Kelly leverage} which maximizes the \emph{utility} is found by equating the derivative of \emph{utility} to zero:
      \begin{displaymath}
        \frac{\mathrm{d} u_r}{\mathrm{d}\kappa} = \bar{r} - \kappa \sigma^2 + \kappa^2 \hat{s} - \kappa^3 \hat{k} = 0
      \end{displaymath}
    \column{0.5\textwidth}
      Assuming that $\hat{s}$ and $\hat{k}$ are small and can be neglected, we get:
      \begin{displaymath}
        \kappa = \frac{\bar{r}}{\sigma^2} = \frac{S_r}{\sigma} \; ; \quad u_r = \frac{1}{2} \frac{{\bar{r}}^2}{\sigma^2} = \frac{1}{2} S_r^2
      \end{displaymath}
      The \emph{Kelly leverage} is \emph{approximately} equal to the \emph{Sharpe ratio} divided by the \emph{standard deviation}.
      \vskip1ex
      The optimal utility $u_r$ is \emph{approximately} equal to half the \emph{Sharpe ratio} $S_r$ squared.
      \vskip1ex
      The \emph{standard deviation} and \emph{Sharpe ratio} are calculated over the same time interval as the returns (not annualized).

      In reality investors don't know the probability of winning or the odds of the gamble, so they can't accurately calculate the optimal \emph{Kelly fraction}.

      The \emph{Kelly fraction}: $\kappa = \frac{\bar{r}}{\sigma^2}$ is especially sensitive to the uncertainty of the expected returns $\bar{r}$.

      Risk aversion is the investor preference to avoid losses more than to seek similar percentage gains in wealth.
      \vskip1ex
      For example, for a risk averse investor, a 10\% loss of wealth is more severe than a 10\% gain.
      \vskip1ex
      Risk aversion is associated with the \emph{diminishing marginal utility} of the \emph{percentage change in wealth} $\Delta w$.

      This manifests itself as a concave utility function, with a negative second derivative $u''(w) < 0$.
      \vskip1ex
      For example, the \emph{logarithmic utility} function is concave.
      \vskip1ex
      The Arrow-Pratt coefficient of relative risk aversion is proportional to the convexity $u''(w)$ of the utility, and is defined as: $\eta = - \frac{w \, u''(w)}{u'(w)}$.

      It's not a given that all investors have a risk aversion coefficient equal to $1$, and other \emph{utility functions} are possible.

\subsection{The Utility of Lottery Tickets}
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{\subsecname}

  \begin{columns}[T]
    \column{0.5\textwidth}
      Lottery tickets are equivalent to binary gambles with a very small probability of winning $p$, but a very large winning amount $a$, and a small loss amount $b$ equal to the ticket price.
      \vskip1ex
      The expected payout $\mu = p \, a - q \, b$ of most lottery tickets is negative.
      \vskip1ex
      So under \emph{logarithmic utility}, the Kelly fraction $\kappa$ for most lottery tickets is also negative, meaning that investors should not be expected to buy these lottery tickets.
      \vskip1ex
      But in reality many people do buy lottery tickets with negative expected payouts, which means that their utility functions are not logarithmic.
      \vskip1ex
      The demand for lottery tickets can be explained by assuming a strong demand for positive \emph{skewness}, which exceeds the demand for a positive payout.
      \vskip1ex
      People buy lottery tickets because they want a small chance of a very large payout, even if the average payout is negative.
    \column{0.5\textwidth}
      Without loss of generality we can assume that the lottery ticket price is one dollar $b = 1$, that it pays out $a$ dollars, and that the expected payout is equal to zero: $\mu = p \, a - q \, b = 0$.
      \vskip1ex
      Then the probability of winning is equal to: 
      $p = \frac{1}{a + 1}$.
      \vskip1ex
      And the \emph{skewness} is equal to: 
      $\hat{s} = \frac{a^3}{a + 1} - \frac{a}{a + 1} = a (a - 1)$.
      \vskip1ex
      So the positive \emph{skewness} of a lottery ticket increases as the square of the \emph{betting odds}, and it can become very large.

      Investor risk and return preferences depend on the signs of the derivatives of their \emph{utility} function.
      \vskip1ex
      Investors with \emph{logarithmic utility} have positive \emph{odd} derivatives ($u'(w) > 0$ and $u'''(w) > 0$) and negative \emph{even} derivatives ($u''(w) < 0$ and $u''''(w) < 0$), which is typical for most other investors as well.
      \vskip1ex
      \emph{Risk averse} investors have a negative second derivative of utility $u''(w) < 0$.
      \vskip1ex
      The demand for lottery tickets shows that investors' utility typically has a positive third derivative $u'''(w) > 0$.
      \vskip1ex
      Positive \emph{odd} derivatives imply a preference for larger \emph{odd moments} of the change of wealth distribution (mean, skewness).
      \vskip1ex
      Negative \emph{even} derivatives imply a preference for smaller \emph{even moments} (variance, kurtosis).
      \vskip1ex
      The preference for smaller \emph{variance} is called \emph{risk aversion}, for larger \emph{skewness} is called \emph{prudence}, and for smaller \emph{kurtosis} is called \emph{temperance}.
    \column{0.5\textwidth}
      The expected change of the \emph{utility} of wealth $\Delta u(w)$ can be expanded in the moments of the change of wealth distribution:
      \begin{flalign*}
        \Delta u(w) &= u'(w) \Delta w + \frac{u''(w)}{2} \sigma^2 &\\
        & + \frac{u'''(w)}{3!} \hat{s} + \frac{u''''(w)}{4!} \hat{k}
      \end{flalign*}
      Where $\Delta w$ is the expected change of wealth, $\sigma^2 = \int {w^2 \, p(w) \, \mathrm{d}w}$ is the \emph{variance} of the change of wealth, $\hat{s} = \int {w^3 \, p(w) \, \mathrm{d}w}$ is the \emph{skewness}, and $\hat{k} = \int {r^4 \, p(w) \, \mathrm{d}w}$ is the \emph{kurtosis}.
